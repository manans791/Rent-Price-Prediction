# Project Summary: House Rent Prediction

### Live Demo - https://rentpricedetection.azurewebsites.net/

## Problem Statement:
In urban areas, new residents often face challenges in finding affordable rental accommodations. Property dealers sometimes take advantage of their unfamiliarity with local rental rates, leading to situations where newcomers overpay for rent. This project aims to address this issue by developing a system that predicts rental prices based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, property size, number of bathrooms, city location, furnishing status, and tenant preferences. By providing accurate rental price predictions, this system helps individuals make informed decisions and avoid overpaying for rent.

## Tools and Techniques:
- **Frontend Development:** HTML and CSS are used to design and structure the user interface for the rent prediction system.
- **Backend Development:** Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python, is employed to build the backend of the system, handle HTTP requests, and serve predictions.
- **Machine Learning Algorithm:** Linear Regression is utilized as the primary machine learning algorithm for predicting rental prices based on the input features.
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook in Python is used for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Progress:
- The project achieved an initial accuracy of 71% using a basic linear regression model.
- Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV, resulting in an improved accuracy of 76%.

## Further Scope:
- Enhance the user interface by incorporating modern frontend technologies and design principles to improve user experience.
- Explore the use of more complex machine learning algorithms or ensemble techniques to further improve prediction accuracy.
- Incorporate additional features and datasets to enrich the model's understanding and prediction capabilities.
- Expand the scope of the project to include features such as neighborhood amenities, transportation accessibility, and rental trends to provide more comprehensive predictions.
